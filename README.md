# Skate-Trick-Combo-Generator
Wrote a Python program to produce valid and randomized skate trick combinations to provide creative inspiration for learning new tricks. Program can generate trick combo ideas for a variety of obstacles including ledges, manual pads, and rails. Currently am in the process of improving the functions and translating them into Swift so that they can be incoporated into an iOS app.
